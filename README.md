`Zig v0.13.0` - `Just v1.37.0` - `No-Dependencies`

Hello ðŸ‘‹. My name is Zach.

I am a Software Developer who loves to learn everything there is about programming. I may not be the best but I give it my all.

This year I am sticking with [`Ziglang`](https://ziglang.org/) throughout the challenge. I want to learn more about the language and hope by the end I can reach for Zig as a tool comfortably.

I would also like to note that I am using a [`justfile`](https://just.systems/) to template the days and parts along with running a specific day.

To run a specific solution run `just day {day}-{part}` ex. `just day 1-2`.
